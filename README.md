# Advent of Code
My attempts on solving AOC2023 questions. As you can probably see from my spaghetti noodles, my programming skills isn't that good. ;-;
<br> I'll still do my best at solving as many questions as I can. Of course, I'm not gonna copy any solutions from other people, and I'll just take it as granted if I can't solve a question.
<br> My solution will be updated as soon I solve both parts to the solution. If I can't solve the second part, I'll update the repository the next day.

# TODO
Finish D10-2
Finish D12
Revise D14-2 so it doesn't require human brain to solve it
